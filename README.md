Articles within navigations
===========================

Show articles within navigation menus.

Articles can be configured within the page structure and can be selected per page and module. So it is possible to use 
different articles for different navigations modules displaying the same page.

**The "nav_bbit_navi_art" or another proper customized navigation template is required in order to display the 
associated articles.**

**Navigation sublevels can be inserted at the desired position within
the article by using the insert tag {{bbit_navi_art}} in the
article.**
